### Technologies Used

During the the development of "Journalist-Junction.com", we harnessed an array of technologies, each serving a vital role:

- Java with Spring Boot: This combination allowed us to expedite Java application development while enabling the creation of vital APIs and database repositories;

- JavaScript: Utilized to enhance the front-end with dynamic interactivity and creating a user-friendly interface;

- React: Renowned for its capacity to construct interactive and dynamic UI components, React served as our primary library for web application development.

- S3 (AWS): This service is the foundation of the functionality to post different photos on articles;

- PostgreSQL: Acting as our primary database management system, PostgreSQL ensured efficient data storage and retrieval.

- Postman: Facilitated API testing and validation, ensuring the reliability and functionality of our APIs.

- Bootstrap: For creating impressive and responsive styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

### Challenges

During development, we encountered a few challenges that managed to teach us important lessons, including:

- Working with Complex Entities and the Relationships Between Them;

- Fetching Inside Backend.

- Learning and Working With S3(AWS);
